# new_moon
New program to run moonboard from sql database found in android appdata (no more scraping moon website)
SQL database can be found in root/data/data/com.moonclimbing.moonboard/files
hopefully will be getting a functional GUI with TKINTER as well which will aloow sorting of problems in a useful manner
